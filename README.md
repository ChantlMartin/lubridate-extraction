Extracting Date and Time Components with Lubridate

Trying some code out on the San Francisco Crime Classification Dataset on Kaggle. 
(Find the challenge/code here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime)

This code shows how to convert the date variable into class = POSIXt 
and extract all of the time components (year, month, day, hour, minutes, and seconds)
and put them into unique variables.
